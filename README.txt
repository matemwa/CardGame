This programme is a simple card game.

It is powered by 1-input.txt file from Files folder and can be formatted to change the input of decks. 
Make sure the 1-input.txt exists. Otherwise it won't compile.
Only properly formatted file will work within the application.

Decks in 1-input.txt should be in format eg.:

	[2-A] - (all colors, all figures)
	H[2-3] - (hearts, 2 and 3)
	HDCS[2-5] - (hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades, figures from 2 to 5)
	HDCS[2-A] == [2-A]


There are 5 tasks, each one returns an output to the Files folder.

Task 5 is not yet done.
Task 'all' performs tasks 1-5. (Currently without task 5).
